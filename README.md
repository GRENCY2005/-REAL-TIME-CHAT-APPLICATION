## DESCRIPTION

###  Task Description

The aim of this project is to build a Real-Time Chat Application using WebSockets and a front-end framework such as React.js. The application will allow multiple users to send and receive messages instantly in a shared chat room. The focus is on creating a smooth, fast, and responsive chatting experience with live message updates and message history.

### Core Features to Implement:

### User Join Feature:
Users can enter their name to join the chat. Each user will be assigned a username displayed with their messages.

### Real-Time Messaging:
Messages are sent and received instantly using WebSockets. As soon as a user sends a message, it should appear in the chat window for all users without refreshing the page.

### Message Display:
Each message should show:
- The sender's name
- The message text
- The time it was sent

### Message History:
Store recent chat messages locally or on the server so users can see the previous chat history when they join.

### Frontend Framework:
Use React.js to build components for:
- Message list
- Input field
- Join chat screen

### Technologies Used:
- React.js for the frontend
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- HTML/CSS for styling and layout

### Deliverable:
A styled, interactive, and multi-page e-learning platform UI that:
- Shows a course list
- Embeds videos
- shows course progress
